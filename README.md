Hello there! 👋

I'm Mark, and I'm a Scala nerd. 🤓

I try and maintain a tech blog at https://alterationx10.com 📝

I'm currently most excited about using Scala 3 to build slim frameworks and
libraries over at the [Scala Works](https://github.com/scala-works) GitHub org
to make working with Scala as drop-dead simple as possible, particularly for
onboarding developers from other languages.
