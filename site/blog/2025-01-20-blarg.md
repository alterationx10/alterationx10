# Blarg!

This is my first post on my new site, built with [blarg](https://github.com/wishingtreedev/blarg) - my markdown bases
static site generator, written in Scala! The markdown files are parsed with the `commonmark-java` library, but the
`blarg` tool is built with my `Ursula` cli library, the site is templated with my `Mustachio` mustache template engine I
built (initially for this tool!), and served via my `Spider`wrapper over the built-in java http server. The last bit is
just for fun, and more dog-fooding of my own libraries, since a static site could be deployed in simpler ways than a
scale-to-zero deployment on fly.io üòÅ

Not only have I found + fixed some issues in my own libraries along the way, but I even got to contribute back to open
source projects, like the official Mustache spec! My JSON parser doesn't seem to handle a NBSP character, and there was
one hiding in one of the spec files üò≠
