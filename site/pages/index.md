Hello, and welcome to (the latest incarnation of) my site! 👋

I'm Mark - a software engineer with a PhD in Theoretical Chemistry who traded molecular simulations for building
software in Scala (or talking about Scala while building software in a different language 😁). I've spent my career
building across startups and scale-ups, wrangling Kubernetes clusters, and occasionally firing up a CO2 laser cutter for
good measure.

Head over to the [blog](/latest) section to see my latest ramblings, check out [about](/about) for some of my work
history, or the external links in the footer to get in contact with me elsewhere!
