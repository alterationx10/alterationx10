Hello, and welcome to my site! ðŸ‘‹

If you've been here before, you may notice that it looks different. I haven't
had the time to maintain my blog for a while, and my most meaningful
contributions are usually contributed to other sites, so I removed that part of
my site. I tried to keep the useful content up at the relevant links though, in
case you had something bookmarked!

For now, this will probably remain a personal profile site. Check out
[about](/about) for some of my work history, or the external links in the
footer to get in contact with me elsewhere!
