Hello there! :wave:

I'm Mark, and I'm a Scala nerd.

This site is my tech blog, largely about and related to all things Scala. I use ZIO at work, so you'll likely find a
healthy dose of that here as well.

Given the opportunity, I will likely talk to you about kubernetes as well :angel:

## Speaking of Work

I work in Special Projects at Carvana - If you'd like to write Scala with me, check out our job listing at
[https://grnh.se/85d50e681us](https://grnh.se/85d50e681us). Special Projects is especially remote-friendly, so moving to
Oakland, CA/Phoenix, AZ is optional :wink:
