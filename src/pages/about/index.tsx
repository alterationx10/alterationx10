          This site is my tech blog, largely about and related to all things
          Scala. I use ZIO at work, so you'll likely find a healthy dose of that
          here as well.

            multi-billion dollar hedge fund based in Stamford, Connecticut. I
            worked to troubleshoot, improve, and document their containerized

            Vaspian is a cloud-based VoIP provider located in Buffalo, NY. In my
            time there, I focused on building and automating platforms that
            provide advanced analytics and interfaces to our customers, as well
            as enhanced operational tools for internal service provisioning.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the larger projects I lead while working there include:</p>
          <h4>In-House Kubernetes</h4>
          <p>
            Designed, built, and maintain our own bare-metal Kubernetes cluster
            for application deployment. Building this all-in-one system allowed
            us to more reliably deliver our current applications/services to our
            customers, promptly roll out new features, as well as offer new
            services that were intractable to manage before.
          </p>
          <h4>Customer Facing Applications</h4>
          <p>
            Built and maintain our main customer facing portal, which provides
            custom reporting and real-time event integration with our core phone
            system. Using Scala and Akka, along with the Play Framework, we have
            been able to roll out stable, scalable services that are agile
            enough to grow with our customers.
          </p>
          <h4>Internal Tooling</h4>
          <p>
            Built and maintain middleware for maintenance/administration of
            systems built by our internal Network Engineers which allows our
            customer service/support staff to perform more technical tasks such
            as:
            <ul>
              <li>Dynamically provision custom services for our customers</li>
              <li>Manage and troubleshoot customer configurations</li>
              <li>Monitor customer service status in real time</li>
            </ul>

            Sensorcon is a developer and manufacturer of environmental sensors
            located in Williamsville, NY. In my time there, I was part of a
            small start-up team focusing on bringing products to market from the
            ground up. My primary focus was working with firmware engineers to
            write libraries and customer facing applications (iOS, Android, PC)
            that could talk to our sensor devices via Bluetooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relevant software projects include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                iOS/Android/Java API library development to integrate with our
                sensors
              </li>
              <li>iOS/Android App development</li>
              <li>
                Internal inventory system to improve our manufacturing capacity
              </li>
              <li>
                Automated QA testing protocols and procedures for sensor
                development, to enable technicians to batch process sensors in a
                reliable and repeatable manner
              </li>
              <li>
                Automated QC testing procedures for production, to promptly
                identify issues before they reached consumers
              </li>
